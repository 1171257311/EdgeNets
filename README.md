# DiCENet: Depth-wise Convolutions for Efficient Networks

This repo contains source code of our paper, DiCENet.

**Key highlights**
 * Object classification on the ImageNet and MS-COCO (multi-label)
 * Semantic Segmentation on the PASCAL VOC and the CityScapes
 * Object Detection on the PASCAL VOC and the MS-COCO
 * Supports PyTorch 0.4 and 1.0
 * Integrated with Tensorboard for easy visualization of training logs. 
 * Scripts for downloading different datasets.
 
 
## Object Classification

### Training and Testing on the ImageNet

### Training and Testing on the MS-COCO


## Semantic Segmentation

### Training and Testing on the PASCAL VOC

**Dataset:** A standard practice to train segmentation model on the PASCAL VOC is with additional images from the MS-COCO and .
